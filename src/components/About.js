      <p>
        As an experienced Software Engineering student from VIT Chennai, I possess a strong foundation in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Beyond technical expertise, I've delved into risk management through projects like the Intelligent Plant Monitoring System. My collaboration and teamwork skills have been honed through hands-on API development, problem-solving challenges, and effective communication. My stint at Oasis InfoByte further refined my remote collaboration abilities, while my proficiency in poster designing and video editing has amplified project presentations.
